                    So here, we explore the bounds of javascript with the handiness of a canvas. I've
                    drawn up some things here in the hopes of building upon an arcade fighting game.
                    There's a lot to be added to this, so please bear with me as I venture off into
                    new lands never explored before :D
                </p>

                    Your browser doesn't support the canvas tag. Try <a href="http://chrome.google.com/">Google Chrome</a>.
